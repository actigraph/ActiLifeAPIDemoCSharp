ActiLifeAPIDemoCSharp
=====================

Basic CSharp implementation of the ActiLife API. The demo runs through basic API 'tests' that target specific features of the API; these 'tests' are extendable to qualify return values from ActiLife.

* ActiLife must be running before starting the API demo.
* The API feature toggle must be licensed through ActiGraph.
* This codebase does not handle disconnections or the need to wait for Actilife; this must be implemented in a seperated thread.
